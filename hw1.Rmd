* Part 1


```{r theA, cache = TRUE}
a=120
```

```{r,cache = TRUE}
(c=a/3)
```

```{r, cache = TRUE, dependson = "theA"}
(c=a/3)
```

* Part 2
```{r rvx, cache = TRUE}
x=rnorm(100)
median(x)
mean(x)
sd(x)
```
Analysis of the random data: 
The results are normal since they are very close to 0,0,1.
```{r, dependson= "rvx"}
hist(x)  
```
