I love photography, video games, and reading. One interesting fact about me is that this is my first semester at PSU since I'm a transfer student.

My favorite quote is

My favorite hobbies are swimming and playing video games. An interesting fact about me is that I was born on Christmas.

My favorite quote is:

## R Markdown Syntax
* Part 1


```{r theA, cache = TRUE}
a=120
```

```{r,cache = TRUE}
(c=a/3)
```

```{r, cache = TRUE, dependson = "theA"}
(c=a/3)
```

* Part 2
```{r rvx, cache = TRUE}
x=rnorm(100)
median(x)
mean(x)
sd(x)
```
Analysis of the random data: 
The results are normal since they are very close to 0,0,1.
```{r, fig.cap="**Histogram:** 100 random virables from normal random distribution", fig.align='center', dependson= "rvx"}
hist(x,main="", col = "blue")  
```

* Part 3
$$ùîº[var(v_{1}(\hat{\theta },n)|\hat{\theta})]=var(v_{1}(\theta _{0},0))+ùîº[\vartheta _{p}(D_{1}(\theta ^{*},n)(\hat{\theta }-\theta _{0}),...,D_{p}(\theta ^{*},n)(\theta -\theta _{0}))]$$ 
$$=var(v_{1}(\theta _{0},n)+\vartheta (n^{-2}))$$
